            Taskup is an online tool for managing projects and personal tasks.
            That may sound rather prosaic. But this increasingly popular app
            often inspires the sort of passion usually reserved for consumer
            apps like Pinterest or Instagram. <br /><br />It’s the kind of

          users — now with one million monthly actives — turning their projects,
          whether household to-do lists or corporate realignment plans, into
          visual boards using its cloud-based software.<br /><br />
          I’ve been using it for five months now without fail, synthesizing
          everything from Covey and Allen that stuck, along with Carson and
          Babauta’s wisdom, to create the only task management system that’s
          ever really worked for me.
